# Palm Life
Conway's Game of life for Palm OS

## Setup
I followed this guide to get the development environment set up on my machine

https://palm2000.com/projects/compilingAndBuildingPalmOsAppsOnUbuntu2004LTS.php

There is a zip file containing everything you need to build palm apps.
I modified my makefile to use the `$PALMDEV` environment variable to point to where I extracted these files.
